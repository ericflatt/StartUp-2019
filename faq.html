        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <br>
          
          <h5>What Is SCAD StartUp?</h5>
          <p>You know when you get unshakeable ideas that basically prove your genius? Well, this is a week-long design competition where you get to flesh them out with up to four other friends and pitch it to a group of mock-investors at the end. Similar to Shark Tank, just not on TV. 
          </p>
          
            <h5>Can I Participate?</h5>
          <p>To participate in this startup event, you must be a SCAD student. All undergraduate and graduate students are invited to join the party. Any year, any major. 
          </p>
          
            <h5>How are teams set up?</h5>
          <p>You’re more than welcome to plan your team ahead of time. Teams must be 2-5 people, and must represent a minimum of two majors. 
          </p>
          
             <h5>What if I don't have a team?</h5>
          <p>No worries, you don’t need to have a team before coming to the Kickoff event. You’ll be able to meet new people at StartUp Sessions following the Kickoff, and we’ll help you find fellow geniuses to work with. Just make sure to notify us on the registration form.
          </p>
          
               <h5>And if I'm crowned champion?</h5>
          <p>If your team takes the first place crown, your group will win $2,000. Second place, $1,000. And in third place, $500. For all winners, you’ll receive extra merch, total bragging rights, and other cool stuff. And most importantly, you’ll walk out with something badass to put on your resume &amp; portfolio.
          </p>
          
               <h5>Ok, and I forgot to RSVP?</h5>
          <p>There’s still a chance. If people who RSVP’d don’t show up, a standby line will open at 12:30pm outside of the SCAD Museum of Art on the day of the kickoff. Once registration ends at 12:45, we’ll start letting people in, first-come first-served. So come early.
          </p>
          
               <h5>How much do I have to pay for this?</h5>
          <p>It's completely free. </p>
          
            <h5>Am I even qualified?</h5>
          <p>Yes you are! Leave your resume at home. We know you’ve got skill.</p>
          
           <h5>What do I bring to the Kickoff Event and StartUp Sessions?</h5>
          <p>
            1. Proof you go here. A student ID will do.
        <br>
              2. Laptop &amp; phone.
        <br>
              3. Chargers. Duh
        <br>
              4. Stuff that helps you design.
        <br>
              5. Hunger to shake things up.
